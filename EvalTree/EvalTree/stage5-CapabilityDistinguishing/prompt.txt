## Task
You are given a high-level capability and a list of its {num_sub_capabilities} sub-capabilities. Distill each sub-capability into a concise phrase that is **as short as possible** while **clearly highlighting its unique focus** for distinction.

To better understand the relationship between the capability and its sub-capabilities, think of the capability as a collective set of the provided sub-capabilities, representing their union.

## High-Level Capability
{high_level_capability}

## Sub-Capabilities
{sub_capabilities}

## Requirements
- Provide **one concise phrase** per sub-capability.
- Output each phrase as a standalone phrase with **no additional text, prefixes, symbols, or notations** on any line. For example, do NOT include numbered list markers, numerical prefixes, or numeric labels (e.g., '1.', '2.', etc.) in the output.
- Always output exactly {num_sub_capabilities} lines, each containing a single phrase.
